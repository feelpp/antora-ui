The `manuals` and `toolboxes` layouts provide sophisticated card-based organization systems. These layouts automatically generate visual cards for related pages based on tagging and parent-catalog relationships.

Key features:
- Automatic card generation based on page tags
- Font Awesome icon support for illustrations
- Hierarchical organization with parent-catalog relationships
- Flexible content filtering within or across modules
- Group titles for multi-tag displays
