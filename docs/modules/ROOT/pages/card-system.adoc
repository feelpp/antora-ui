The Feel++ Antora UI features a sophisticated card-based navigation system that automatically generates visual cards for related content based on page attributes and tagging.

== System Overview

The card system consists of several key components:

Page Card Partial:: Renders individual cards with illustrations, titles, and descriptions
Get Page Cards Helper:: JavaScript helper that finds and filters pages for card display
Manuals Layout:: Handlebars layout that orchestrates card rendering
CSS Styling:: Responsive card layouts with hover effects and proper spacing

== Card Generation Process

1. **Page Discovery**: The system searches for pages based on `parent-catalogs` and `page-tags` attributes
2. **Filtering**: Pages are filtered by the `page-cards-tag` criteria
3. **Illustration Processing**: Font Awesome icons are detected and processed differently from images
4. **Card Rendering**: Each page is rendered as a card with title, description, and illustration
5. **Layout Application**: Cards are arranged in responsive grids with proper spacing

== Helper Functions

get-page-cards:: Basic helper that returns pages matching specified criteria
get-page-cards-multi:: Advanced helper that can group pages by multiple tags
regexMatch:: Utility helper for detecting Font Awesome classes in illustrations

== CSS Classes and Styling

The card system uses several CSS classes for styling:

.page-card:: Main card container with hover effects
.page-card-illustration:: Container for icons or images
.page-card-body:: Text content area with title and description
.cards-group-title:: Optional titles for grouped card sections

== Responsive Behavior

Cards automatically adapt to different screen sizes:

Desktop:: Multi-column grid layout with full card details
Tablet:: Reduced columns with maintained aspect ratios
Mobile:: Single column stack with optimized spacing

== Advanced Features

Multi-Tag Grouping:: Group cards by different tags with section titles
Cross-Module Search:: Find cards across different Antora modules
Empty Card Handling:: Graceful handling of missing content or broken references
Order Control:: Use `page-cards-order` attribute for custom sorting

== Integration with Antora

The card system integrates seamlessly with Antora's content model:

- Uses Antora's page discovery and navigation systems
- Leverages Antora's image resolution for illustrations
- Respects Antora's module boundaries and versioning
- Works with Antora's URL generation and linking

== Best Practices

Consistent Tagging:: Use consistent tag naming conventions across your documentation
Meaningful Descriptions:: Write clear, concise descriptions for card previews
Appropriate Illustrations:: Choose icons or images that clearly represent the content
Hierarchical Organization:: Use parent-catalog relationships to create logical content hierarchies

== Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

Cards Not Appearing:: Check `parent-catalogs` and `page-tags` spelling and consistency
Missing Illustrations:: Verify Font Awesome class names or image paths
Layout Issues:: Ensure proper `page-layout: manuals` attribute on catalog pages
Cross-Module Problems:: Review `page-cards-within-module` setting for desired scope
