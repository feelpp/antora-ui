:description: Demonstrates the [.lead] variants and themed panels available in this UI

[.lead]
Use a lead paragraph to introduce a page or section with a short summary. It can be plain, framed, rounded, or themed to match the site’s palette.

== Quick Reference

- Base: `[.lead]` — slightly larger text only
- Framed: `[.lead.panel]` — subtle background, thin border, accent bar
- Rounded: add `.rounded` to any framed variant
- Admonition themes: `.note`, `.tip`, `.warning`, `.important`, `.caution`
- Brand themes: `.theme-accent`, `.theme-blue`, `.theme-purple`, `.theme-orange`, `.theme-silver`

== Plain Lead

[.lead]
This is a plain lead paragraph. It increases the font size for a softer, introductory tone.

== Framed Lead

[.lead.panel]
This framed lead uses a subtle panel background, thin border, and a small accent bar on the left.

== Framed + Rounded

[.lead.panel.rounded]
Rounded corners create a friendlier, card-like feel while keeping the same framing.

== Framed Intensities

[.lead.panel.subtle]
Subtle frame: slightly thinner accent bar and the default soft background and border.

[.lead.panel.strong.rounded]
Strong frame: a touch darker background and border with a thicker accent bar.

== Admonition-Themed Variants

[.lead.panel.note.rounded]
“Note” theme: uses the same hues as note admonitions for light emphasis.

[.lead.panel.tip.rounded]
“Tip” theme: a gentle green accent suitable for helpful hints or best practices.

[.lead.panel.warning.rounded]
“Warning” theme: a warm tone for important caveats without being overpowering.

[.lead.panel.important.rounded]
“Important” theme: stronger emphasis for critical information.

[.lead.panel.caution.rounded]
“Caution” theme: attention-grabbing but still subtle and friendly.

== Brand-Themed Variants

[.lead.panel.accent.rounded]
Brand accent theme: tinted background and border derived from the site’s accent color.

[.lead.panel.blue.rounded]
Brand blue theme: soft blue tint with a blue accent bar.

[.lead.panel.purple.rounded]
Brand purple theme: soft purple tint that pairs well with headings.

[.lead.panel.orange.rounded.w-40.justify-self-end]

== Theming Notes

- Framed variants support CSS variables for customization via the theme:
  - `--lead-accent`: color of the left accent bar
  - `--lead-bg`: background color of the panel
  - `--lead-border`: border color of the panel
- Predefined roles set these variables based on the UI palette. Prefer roles over inline styles to keep content portable.
