:description: Demonstrates traditional image usage in page cards instead of Font Awesome icons.
:page-illustration: ROOT:A.png

This manual demonstrates how traditional images are rendered in page cards when not using Font Awesome icons.

== Image Handling

When the page illustration doesn't contain `fa-`, the system treats it as an image path:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:page-illustration: ROOT:A.png
----

This renders as:

[source,html]
----
<img alt="" src="path/to/image.png"/>
----

== Image vs Font Awesome

The page-card partial automatically detects the content type:

Font Awesome Detection:: Uses `regexMatch "fa-"` to detect Font Awesome classes
Image Fallback:: Any non-FA content is treated as an image reference
Antora Resolution:: Images are resolved using Antora's `resolveResourceURL` helper

== Best Practices

Font Awesome Icons:: Use for consistent, scalable iconography across the documentation
Custom Images:: Use for specific illustrations, logos, or complex graphics
Accessibility:: Both approaches support proper alt text and semantic markup
