== Overview

This case study focuses on solving heat transfer problems using Feel++ libraries.

== Problem Description

The problem involves:
- 2D heat conduction
- Dirichlet boundary conditions
- Material properties variation

== Solution Method

We use finite element methods to solve the heat equation.

== Results

The simulation produces temperature distributions across the domain.
