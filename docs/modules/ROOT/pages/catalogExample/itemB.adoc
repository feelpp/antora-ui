This manual showcases advanced features of the catalog system including tag-based organization and card grouping.

== Multi-Tag Support

The catalog system supports multiple organizational approaches:

Single Tag Filtering:: Filter cards by a single tag (e.g., `manual`)
Multi-Tag Grouping:: Group cards by different tags with optional group titles
Cross-Module Search:: Search for cards across different Antora modules

== Tag-Based Organization

This page demonstrates the use of multiple tags:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:page-tags: manual, example-content, advanced
----

Tags serve different purposes:

manual:: Primary content type classification
example-content:: Content category for this demonstration
advanced:: Feature level indicator

== Card Grouping

The catalog layout can group cards by tags and display group titles using the `page-cards-<tag>-title` attribute pattern on the parent catalog page.

== Module Scope Control

The `page-cards-within-module` attribute controls search scope:

true (default):: Search only within the current Antora module
false:: Search across all modules in the site

This enables both focused module-specific catalogs and site-wide content organization.
