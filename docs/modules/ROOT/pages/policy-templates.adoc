This Antora UI includes ready-to-use policy page templates to help you create legally compliant documentation sites.

== Overview

The UI bundle includes template policy pages that you can copy and customize for your project:

* **Terms of Use** - Usage terms and conditions
* **Privacy Policy** - Data protection and privacy practices  
* **Cookie Policy** - Website cookie usage and consent
* **Support Policy** - Support channels and expectations

These templates are designed for:

* GDPR compliance (EU privacy regulations)
* Academic and research projects
* Open-source software projects
* General web application legal requirements

== Quick Start

=== 1. Extract Templates

The policy templates are included in your UI bundle at:

```
_/templates/policy-pages/
├── README.md
├── terms-of-use.adoc
├── privacy-policy.adoc
├── cookie-policy.adoc
└── support-policy.adoc
```

After building your site, copy the templates to your content directory:

```bash
# Copy templates to your Antora pages directory
cp build/site/_/templates/policy-pages/*.adoc docs/modules/ROOT/pages/
```

=== 2. Customize Content

Each template contains placeholder sections to customize:

```adoc
[NOTE]
====
Replace this section with information about your organization:
* Organization name and contact details
* Data controller information
* Jurisdiction and applicable laws
====
```

Update these sections with your specific information.

=== 3. Add to Navigation

Add the policy pages to your `nav.adoc`:

```adoc
* Policies & Legal
** xref:terms-of-use.adoc[Terms of Use]
** xref:privacy-policy.adoc[Privacy Policy]
** xref:cookie-policy.adoc[Cookie Policy]
** xref:support-policy.adoc[Support Policy]
```

=== 4. Footer Integration

The UI footer is already configured to link to policy pages in your component. The links will automatically work once you add the pages to your content.
