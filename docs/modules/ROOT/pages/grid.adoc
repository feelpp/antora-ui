:description: Examples of the grid and image utility classes included in this UI

[.lead.panel.note.rounded]
This page demonstrates the grid and image utility classes bundled with this UI. Use these helpers to build simple, responsive layouts quickly.

== Quick Overview

Grid:: `.grid` container with `.grid-2`, `.grid-3`, or `.grid-4` for columns; add gaps with `.gap-1`, `.gap-2`, `.gap-3`.
Alignment:: `.items-start|center|end` sets vertical alignment; `.justify-start|center|end` sets horizontal alignment for all items; use `.justify-self-*` on a single item.
Images:: `img-fluid` (responsive), `img-shadow` (subtle depth), `img-rounded` (rounded corners); width helpers `w-10`, `w-20`, `w-30`, `w-40`, `w-50`, `w-60`, `w-70`; floats `float-right` and `float-left`.

== Two‑Column: Text | Image

[.grid.grid-2.gap-2.items-center]
--
// Group the text into a single block so the grid has two children (text + image)

====
*Clean two‑column layout*

Use `.grid.grid-2` to create two columns that collapse to one column on small screens. Add `.items-center` to vertically center content and `justify-self-*` to align a single cell.

- Responsive: below 768px, columns stack.
- Spacing: `.gap-2` adds comfortable spacing between columns.
- Image: `img-fluid img-shadow img-rounded w-60` keeps it crisp and contained.

== Three Columns

[.grid.grid-3.gap-2.justify-start]
--
*Focused*
Short, scannable copy works best in compact cards.

*Balanced*
Grids auto-fit at the breakpoint; keep content lengths similar.


*Consistent*
Apply the same spacing and heading levels across cards.

== Four Columns

== Figure with Caption

.Medium width image with shadow centered.

.Medium width image with shadow right aligned.

== Float Right (small images)

image::sample-3.svg[role="img-rounded float-right w-40",alt="Small image"]
Float an image right to let continuous text wrap around it. Prefer small widths (40–50%).

== Tiny Images (10–30%)

[.grid.grid-3.gap-2.items-center.justify-center]
--
image::sample-3.svg[role="img-fluid img-shadow img-rounded w-10 justify-self-center",alt="Tiny image 10%"]
image::sample-3.svg[role="img-fluid img-shadow img-rounded w-20 justify-self-center",alt="Tiny image 20%"]
image::sample-3.svg[role="img-fluid img-shadow img-rounded w-30 justify-self-center",alt="Tiny image 30%"]
--

== Usage Notes

- Add `role="img-fluid img-shadow"` to images to make them responsive and add a subtle elevation.
- Control image size with `w-10` up to `w-70`.
- Use `.grid-2`, `.grid-3`, or `.grid-4` with `.gap-2` for spacing; grids collapse to one column below 768px.
- Align all items with `.items-*` or `.justify-*`; align a single item with `.justify-self-*`.
